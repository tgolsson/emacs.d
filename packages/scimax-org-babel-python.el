;;; scimax-org-babel-python.el --- Scimax extensions for Python in org-mode

;;; Commentary:
;; `beacon' is required - https://github.com/Malabarba/beacon fellow
;; The main goal in this library is providing asynchronous Python execution in org-mode.

;; `number-line-src-block' will put temporary line numbers in a src block that
;; disappear when you type.

;; The variable `org-babel-async-python-show-results' determines if a buffer
;; pops up during execution.

;; The variable `org-babel-async-python-show-line-numbers' determines if line
;; numbers are shown in the src-block if an exception occurs. They disappear
;; when you press a key.

;; The command `org-babel-async-execute:python' executes the src-block at point
;; asynchronously, i.e. you can continue using Emacs while it runs. The results
;; section has two links while it is running, one to open the results buffer,
;; and one to cancel the process. After the job is done, the results are
;; inserted into the buffer.

;; If there is an Exception, then the Traceback is inserted into the buffer,
;; with clickable links to the line(s) causing the error. The cursor will jump
;; to the last line in the Traceback that is in the src-block and shine a beacon
;; to show you where the error is.

;; The links described above are not persistent, and are not regenerated if you
;; close the buffer and reopen it. They are created when you execute the
;; src-block, and they should be active until you close the buffer.

;; `autopep8' will reformat a src-block.

;; `pylint' will run pylint on a src-block and generate a buffer with links to
;; lines that need attention.

:var headers are supported.
:results output is all that is supported for output.

The variable `org-babel-async-python-show-results' determines if
a new window will pop up showing you the output as it appears,
and the output in that window will be put in the RESULTS section
of the code block. If there is an exception, the cursor will jump
back to the line it occurred on in the code block, and the files
in the traceback are clickable.

Use a prefix arg to force it to run if it is already running, or
there is an async marker present.

Note that if there are side effects from the code block these do
not get undone when you kill the process, e.g. if you modify
files.

To make C-c C-c use this, try this.
